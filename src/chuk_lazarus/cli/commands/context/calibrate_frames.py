"""Calibrate dark space coordinate frames for a model.

Two methods:

  whitening (default):
    No predefined categories. Let the model's own geometry define the
    navigation space. Run diverse probes through L26, PCA, skip structural
    PCs (top K), keep the next N PCs, scale each by 1/sqrt(eigenvalue) to
    equalise variance. The whitening transform amplifies the dark space
    signal that structural dominance was hiding.

  category:
    Human-defined content categories (event, sports, technical, etc.).
    Cross-domain PCA with Fisher criterion scoring per category.
    Deduplicated across categories.
